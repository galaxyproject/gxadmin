# 13

- Added:
	- local functions support querying when prefixed with "query-"
	- "meta influx-post" and "meta influx-query" were added to get data into
	  and out of Influx
	- "explainquery" is added as an alternative to csv/tsv/etc queries, which
	  does an "EXPLAIN ANALYZE" of the current SQL
	- "explainjsonquery" added for use with http://tatiyants.com/pev/
	- "time" prefix for all functions added to print execution time to stderr
	- Function to fail a specific job ID
	- "query user-recent-aggregate-jobs"
	- "query history-contents"
	- "query hdca-info"
	- "query hdca-datasets"
	- "mutate fail-history", when failing individual jobs is too slow
	- "galaxy migrate-tool-install-from-sqlite"
	- "query user-cpu-years"
	- Shellchecking of entire script
- Fixed:
	- Escaped commas in influx outputs, switched to tabs to further prevent
	  comma issues.
	- Correct date filter in "query {server-groups,server-datasets}"
	- Removed unnecessary function name duplication, e.g.
	    "query_filter() { ## query filter [id]: Does thing"
	  can now be written as
	    "query_filter() { ## [id]: Does thing"

# 12

- Added:
	- local functions, users can add functions to a separate file which are
	  made available in gxadmin. @erasche resisted implementing these for a
	  long time for fears that they won't be contributed back and everyone
	  would keep their precious sql private. So they may nag you occasionally
	  to contribute them back.
	- (semi) EU specific systemd handler/zergling management commands
	- filter digest-color: command to colour some text
	- filter identicon: command to generate an identicon
	- Some basic testing of the overall script
- Fixed:
	- Correct time zones in all queries to be client-side time zones rather
	  than UTC encoded timestamps as stored in db (Thanks [@slugger70](https://github.com/Slugger70)!)
	- Renamed: "query monthly-users" â†’ "query monthly-users-active"
- Removed:
	- Removed highly EU specific handler and zerg functions
	- Deprecated: "query active-users"
- Changed:
	- Major internal reorganisation and split into parts for easier editing. A
	  bash script that needs a build system, truly horrifying.
	- User info query now shows recent WF invocations and whether their largest
	  histories are deleted or purged or not.
	- Separated out 'report' types that are markdown-only outputs and don't
	  support tsv/csv queries

# 11

	- filter hexdecode: to help decode hex blobs in postgres queries
	- uwsgi stats\_influx: which fetches stats from uWSGI zerglings

	- workflow-connections: Exports worfklow connections, input to output tools

	- user-details: now reports in markdown compatible output and with more
	  information about the user
	- job-info: now reports in markdown compatible output, including job inputs
	  + outputs
	- queue-overview: now includes user ID by default ("GDPR_MODE=1" will set
	  the value to "0"), and allows using shorter tool IDs
	- user-details: renamed to user-info
	- user-info: includes largest histories

# 10

- Added:
	- old-histories: Old histories query to find histories that haven't been
